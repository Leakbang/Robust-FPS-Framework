 ## Contributions
 Contributions are extremely welcome as I am new to Godot and I am learning as I do things. I greatly appreciate contributions.

 ## License
 The original source code in this repository falls under GPL3. However, this repository includes external assets. Please check the original licensing of the included assets.  

 ## Credits
 It wouldn't have been possible without the incredible godot community. In particular I want to thank Linko-3D and Btan2 as my work is based on the work that they have done.  
This project is based on [Btan2's Q_Move](https://github.com/Btan2/Q_Move).  
Originally, this repository contained chunks of code from [Linko-3D's FPS Controller](https://github.com/Linko-3D/First-Person-Controller-FPS). However, all of the imported code has been totally re-written.  
This project wouldn't have taken off without Btan2's and Linko-3D's code.
