 # Robust FPS Framework
 An optimized, robust FPS framework.
 
 ### **Note:** The development will take place on the alternative branch until the physics based player movement is implemented.

 ## Credits
 It wouldn't have been possible without the incredible godot community. In particular I want to thank Linko-3D and Btan2 as my work is based on the work that they have done.
 This contains massive chunks of code forked from [Linko-3D's FPS Controller](https://github.com/Linko-3D/First-Person-Controller-FPS) and [Btan2's Q_Move](https://github.com/Btan2/Q_Move).
 They did the hard work.
