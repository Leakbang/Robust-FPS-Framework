 # Robust FPS Framework
 An optimized, robust FPS framework.

 ## Idea
 The idea behind this project is to make an optimized and robust FPS framework that can be used in a wide range of games.
 Normally I keep repositories like this private, but I think this could be a useful project that people could use to quickly create games with or learn from.

 ## Aim
 The aim of this framework is to replicate a robust FPS experience akin to Half-life with extra interactions.

 ## Contributions
 Contributions are extremely welcome as I have very limited experience with Godot and I am learning as I do things. I greatly appreciate contributions.

 ## License
 The source code in this repo is GPL3, however, check the original Licensing of the forked codes and files.

 ## Credits
 It wouldn't have been possible without the incredible godot community. In particular I want to thank Linko-3D and Btan2 as my work is based on the work that they have done.
 This contains massive chunks of code forked from [Linko-3D's FPS Controller](https://github.com/Linko-3D/First-Person-Controller-FPS) and [Btan2's Q_Move](https://github.com/Btan2/Q_Move).
 They did the hard work.
